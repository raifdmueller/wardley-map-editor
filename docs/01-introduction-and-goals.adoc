== Chapter 1: Introduction and Goals

=== 1.1 Requirements Overview

The Wardley Map Editor is a web-based application developed live during "Software Architektur im Stream" to demonstrate practical AI-assisted architecture work.

**Core Purpose:**
> Create a functional Wardley Map editor with draw.io export capability in a 1-hour live development session, proving that LLMs can contribute real value beyond "architecture theater."

=== 1.2 Quality Goals

The following quality goals are prioritized in order of importance:

[cols="1,3,2", options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Quality Goal | Rationale
| 1 | **Time-to-Market** | Must deliver working prototype in exactly 1 hour live stream
| 2 | **Usability** | Intuitive operation without tooltips or complex tutorials
| 3 | **Wow-Effect** | Smooth drag&drop and polished interactions for demo impact
|===

**Critical Trade-off Decision:**
Usability is prioritized over visual effects when conflicts arise. The application should work intuitively rather than look fancy.

=== 1.3 Stakeholders

|===
| Stakeholder | Role | Expectations
| **Ralf D. MÃ¼ller** | Stream Host, Architect, Product Owner | Working demo, architectural learning, successful stream content
| **Stream Audience** | Observers, Learners | Educational value, witnessing real human-AI collaboration, entertainment
|===

**Excluded Stakeholders:**
- Wardley Map Community (future potential users)
- docToolchain/arc42 Community (potential reference case)

These groups are explicitly excluded to maintain focus on the immediate live demonstration goals.

=== 1.4 System Features (MVP)

**Must-Have Features:**
- Interactive canvas with Wardley Map axes (Genesis-Custom, Visible-Invisible)
- Component placement via drag&drop
- Basic connections between components  
- Export to draw.io XML format

**Should-Have Features (if time permits):**

- Local storage persistence
- Basic visual styling

**Could-Have Features (likely out of scope):**
- Advanced UI controls
- DSL parser for text input
- Comprehensive validation
- Multi-map management
