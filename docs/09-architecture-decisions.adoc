=== 9.2 Decision Process and Methodology

==== Evaluation Framework

All architectural decisions follow a systematic evaluation process using **Pugh Matrix analysis** to ensure objective comparison of alternatives:

**Pugh Matrix Process:**
1. **Baseline Selection**: Choose simplest or current solution as reference (score = 0)
2. **Alternative Identification**: List viable alternatives for comparison
3. **Criteria Definition**: Establish relevant evaluation criteria
4. **Relative Scoring**: Compare each alternative to baseline (-1, 0, +1)
5. **Total Calculation**: Sum scores to identify optimal solution
6. **Rationale Documentation**: Explain scoring and rejected alternatives

**Decision Criteria Categories:**
- **Time-to-Market**: Development speed and implementation complexity
- **Quality Goals**: Alignment with usability, performance, and wow-effect requirements
- **Technical Constraints**: Browser compatibility, hosting limitations, dependency management
- **Future Extensibility**: Ability to evolve and extend the solution
- **AI-Development Efficiency**: Suitability for AI-assisted development workflows

==== Decision Quality Metrics

**Decision Success Factors:**
- Clear problem statement and context
- Comprehensive alternative evaluation
- Quantitative scoring where possible
- Explicit trade-off identification
- Implementation feasibility assessment
- Future impact consideration

=== 9.3 ADR-001: SVG-based Rendering Engine

=== 9.4 ADR-002: Separate Data Model for State Management

**link:adr-002-data-model.adoc[→ Full ADR Document]**

==== Decision Summary
Chose **separate JavaScript data model** as single source of truth over direct DOM manipulation or hybrid approaches.

==== Key Evaluation Results
[cols="3,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Criterion | Direct DOM (Baseline) | Separate Data Model | Hybrid Approach
| Live-Debugging Support | 0 | +2 | +1
| Future Extensibility | 0 | +2 | +1
| Undo/Redo Preparation | 0 | +2 | +1
| Implementation Speed | 0 | -1 | -2
| State Synchronization | 0 | -2 | -2
| **Total Score** | **0** | **0** | **-4**
|===

**Tie-Breaking Factors:**
Despite equal scores, separate data model was chosen for **long-term architectural value**:
- Professional software architecture patterns
- Clear separation of concerns
- Foundation for advanced features (undo/redo, persistence, validation)
- Better testability and maintainability

**Impact on Solution:**
- Central `WardleyMap` class manages all business logic
- Observer pattern enables model-view synchronization
- Clear API boundaries for each layer
- Simplified export logic through structured data access

=== 9.5 ADR-003: ES6 Classes with Modular Architecture

**link:adr-003-code-structure.adoc[→ Full ADR Document]**

==== Decision Summary
Selected **ES6 Classes with modular file structure** over monolithic or pure functional approaches.

==== Key Evaluation Results
[cols="3,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Criterion | Monolithic (Baseline) | Modular Files | ES6 Classes
| AI-Development Efficiency | 0 | +1 | +2
| Live-Debugging Clarity | 0 | +1 | +1
| Code Organization | 0 | +1 | +2
| Stream Educational Value | 0 | 0 | +1
| **Total Score** | **0** | **+4** | **+8**
|===

**Impact on Solution:**
- Clear class hierarchy: `WardleyMap`, `Component`, `Connection`, `SVGRenderer`, `MapEditor`
- Modular file structure enables parallel development concerns
- ES6 module imports provide clean dependency management
- Professional code patterns enhance live stream educational value

=== 9.6 Implicit Decisions and Rationale

==== Technology Stack Decisions

**JavaScript ES6+ (No Framework)**
- **Rationale**: Maximum development speed, no learning curve, direct browser compatibility
- **Alternative Considered**: React, Vue.js, Angular
- **Trade-off**: Rapid development vs. enterprise scalability

**GitHub Pages Hosting**
- **Rationale**: Zero-cost hosting, automatic deployment, static file serving
- **Alternative Considered**: Netlify, Vercel, custom server
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs. advanced hosting features

**Template-based XML Export**
- **Rationale**: Fastest implementation path, no external dependencies
- **Alternative Considered**: XML libraries, mxGraph integration
