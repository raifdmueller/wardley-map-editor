**AsciiDoc**::
Lightweight markup language used for writing documentation. Used throughout this project for all architecture documentation following arc42 template standards.

=== B

**Baseline (Pugh Matrix)**::
Reference solution in Pugh Matrix evaluation, always scored as 0. Other alternatives are compared relative to this baseline with scores of -1, 0, or +1.

**Building Block**::
Self-contained architectural component with clearly defined responsibilities and interfaces. Examples include WardleyMap, SVGRenderer, MapEditor.

=== C

**Canvas (HTML5)**::
HTML5 element for programmatic drawing. Considered but rejected in favor of SVG for the rendering engine due to debugging and export compatibility advantages.

**Component (Wardley Map)**::
Individual element in a Wardley Map representing a capability, practice, or technology positioned according to evolution and visibility characteristics.

**Connection**::
Dependency relationship between two components in a Wardley Map, representing flows of data, value, or dependencies.

**Coordinate Transformation**::
Mathematical conversion between Wardley Map semantic coordinates (evolution, visibility) and pixel coordinates for visual rendering.

**Cross-cutting Concept**::
Architectural concept that spans multiple building blocks, such as error handling, logging, or coordinate transformation patterns.

=== D

**DOM (Document Object Model)**::
Browser API for manipulating HTML/XML document structure. Used extensively for SVG rendering and user interaction handling.

**draw.io**::
Web-based diagramming application (diagrams.net). Target export format for Wardley Maps created in this editor.

**Drag & Drop**::
User interaction pattern allowing components to be repositioned by mouse dragging. Core functionality for map editing.

=== E

**ES6 Classes**::
Object-oriented programming constructs in modern JavaScript. Chosen for code organization to provide clear structure and AI-development efficiency.

**Evolution (Wardley Map)**::
Horizontal axis in Wardley Maps representing maturity stages from Genesis (0.0) through Custom (0.25), Product (0.50), to Commodity (1.0).

**Export**::
Process of converting internal map data to external formats, primarily draw.io XML format for integration with external tools.

=== G

**Genesis**::
Earliest evolution stage (0.0-0.25) in Wardley Maps, representing novel, uncertain, and rapidly changing components positioned on the left side of the map.

**GitHub Pages**::
Static web hosting service by GitHub. Chosen as deployment platform due to zero-cost hosting and automatic deployment capabilities.

=== L

**Live Development**::
Real-time software development performed during a live stream with audience observation. Creates unique constraints including time pressure and transparency requirements.

=== M

**Model-View Synchronization**::
Architectural pattern ensuring visual representation (view) stays consistent with underlying data (model) through observer pattern implementation.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**::
Core feature set sufficient to demonstrate value and gather feedback. Focuses on essential functionality: component placement, connections, and draw.io export.

**mxGraph**::
JavaScript diagramming library underlying draw.io. Knowledge of its XML format structure enables compatible export generation.

=== O

**Observer Pattern**::
Design pattern enabling loose coupling between data model and visual representation through event-based notifications.

=== P

**Pugh Matrix**::
Decision evaluation methodology comparing alternatives against a baseline using quantitative scoring. Used systematically for all architectural decisions in this project.

**Pixel Coordinates**::
Screen position measurements in pixels used for SVG rendering. Converted from Wardley semantic coordinates through transformation functions.

=== Q

**Quality Goal**::
Measurable system quality characteristic prioritized for architecture decisions. Primary goals: Time-to-Market, Usability, Wow-Effect.

**Quality Scenario**::
Specific testable situation demonstrating quality goal achievement, including source, stimulus, environment, response, and response measure.

=== R

**Runtime View**::
Architecture documentation showing how building blocks interact during execution to fulfill specific use cases and scenarios.

=== S

**SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**::
XML-based vector graphics format. Chosen as rendering technology for debugging advantages and draw.io export compatibility.

**State Management**::
Coordination of data consistency across application layers, implemented through separate data model with observer-based synchronization.

=== T

**Template-based Generation**::
Code generation approach using predefined templates with dynamic content injection. Used for draw.io XML export for rapid implementation.

**Time-to-Market**::
Primary quality goal representing development speed constraint (1-hour live implementation). Influenced all architectural decisions.

=== U

**User Interaction**::
Interface between user and system, primarily through mouse-based drag & drop operations and click-based component creation.

=== V

**Visibility (Wardley Map)**::
Vertical axis in Wardley Maps representing value chain position from Infrastructure (0.0) to User-Visible (1.0). Determines Y-coordinate positioning.

=== W

**Wardley Map**::
Strategic planning tool developed by Simon Wardley showing components positioned by evolution (X-axis) and visibility (Y-axis) with dependency connections.

**Wow-Effect**::
Tertiary quality goal representing demonstration impact through smooth interactions and impressive technical capabilities like direct draw.io integration.

=== X

**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**::
Structured data format used by draw.io for diagram storage. Generated through template-based approach for map export functionality.
