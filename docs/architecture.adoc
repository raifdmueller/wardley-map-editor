== Development Context

**Live Development Session:**
- Date: June 13, 2025
- Duration: 1 hour
- Participants: Ralf D. MÃ¼ller & Claude (AI Assistant)
- Stream: Software Architektur im Stream

**Quality Goals Priority:**
1. Time-to-Market (1 hour implementation)
2. Usability (intuitive operation) 
3. Wow-Effect (smooth drag&drop)

== Architecture at a Glance

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
- Rendering: SVG + DOM manipulation
- Data: Separate JavaScript data model
- Export: draw.io XML format
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (client-only)

**Core Decisions:**
- SVG over Canvas for development speed and debugging
- Separate data model over direct DOM for extensibility
- Browser-only solution with no server dependencies
