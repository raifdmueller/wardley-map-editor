=== Problem Description and Context

We need to select a rendering technology for the Wardley Map Editor that allows:
- Visual representation of map components (rectangles)
- Interactive drag & drop functionality  
- Line drawing for dependencies
- Export to draw.io XML format

The decision must be made within our 1-hour live-stream timeframe, requiring a technology that can be implemented quickly while providing good user experience.

=== Alternative Evaluation (Pugh Matrix)

|===
| Criterion | Canvas (Baseline) | SVG | 
| Implementation Speed | 0 | +1 |
| Event Handling Complexity | 0 | +1 |
| Performance (Small Scale) | 0 | 0 |
| Code Maintainability | 0 | +1 |
| Debugging Capabilities | 0 | +1 |
| Learning Curve | 0 | +1 |
| **Total Score** | 0 | +5 |
|===

**Rejected Alternatives:**

**Canvas:** While Canvas offers superior performance for large-scale applications (1000+ elements), it requires:
- Manual implementation of hit-testing for mouse events
- Custom coordinate transformation logic
- More complex drag & drop implementation
- No direct DOM inspection capabilities

For our demo scope (10-20 components max), Canvas's performance advantages are not needed, while its complexity would consume valuable implementation time.

=== Decision

**We choose SVG for rendering** the Wardley Map visualization.

**Rationale:**
- **Time Efficiency:** DOM-based event handling reduces implementation complexity
- **Demo Suitability:** Elements are directly inspectable in browser dev tools
- **Sufficient Performance:** SVG handles our target scale (10-20 components) without issues
- **Coordinate Simplicity:** Direct pixel coordinates, no transformation matrices needed
- **CSS Integration:** Styling can be handled through CSS classes

=== Consequences

==== Positive Effects

- **Faster Development:** Reduced implementation time for interactive features
- **Better Debugging:** All map elements visible in DOM inspector during live demo
- **Simpler Codebase:** Less boilerplate code for basic functionality
- **CSS Styling:** Standard web technologies for visual customization

==== Risks

- **Performance Ceiling:** May not scale beyond 100+ components (not relevant for demo)
- **Animation Limitations:** Complex animations less smooth than Canvas (not planned)

==== Technical Debt

**None.** The decision aligns with our demo scope and requirements. Performance limitations and animation constraints are not relevant for our intended use case of 10-20 components in a live demo context.

=== Implementation Notes

**SVG Structure for Wardley Maps:**
```xml
<svg viewBox="0 0 1200 800">
  <!-- Axes -->
  <line x1="100" y1="700" x2="1100" y2="700" /> <!-- Evolution -->
  <line x1="100" y1="100" x2="100" y2="700" />   <!-- Value -->
  
  <!-- Components -->
  <rect id="comp1" x="200" y="300" width="100" height="40" />
  <text x="250" y="325">User Needs</text>
  
  <!-- Dependencies -->
  <line x1="250" y1="340" x2="350" y2="450" />
</svg>
```

**Event Handling:**
```javascript
component.addEventListener('mousedown', startDrag);
component.addEventListener('mousemove', drag);
component.addEventListener('mouseup', endDrag);
```
