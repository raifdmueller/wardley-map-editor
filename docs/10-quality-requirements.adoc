=== 10.2 Quality Scenarios

==== QS-001: Time-to-Market

**Quality Attribute:** Development Speed +
**Scenario:** Live development session constraint +
**Source:** Development team and stream audience +
**Stimulus:** Start of 1-hour development window +
**Environment:** Live streaming environment with time pressure +
**Response:** Deliver working prototype with core functionality +
**Response Measure:** Complete functional demo within exactly 60 minutes

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Focus on MVP features only
- Use familiar technologies (vanilla JS, SVG)
- Avoid complex abstractions initially

==== QS-002: Usability Assessment  

**Quality Attribute:** Usability +
**Scenario:** First-time user interaction evaluation +
**Source:** Stream audience observing demo +
**Stimulus:** User attempts to create basic Wardley Map +
**Environment:** Live demonstration without tutorials +
**Response:** Intuitive interface allows successful completion +
**Response Measure:** Stream audience consensus: "I could use this without help"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Component placement works on first attempt
- Drag operations feel natural and responsive
- Export function is discoverable and functional

==== QS-003: Smooth Drag&Drop Performance

**Quality Attribute:** Wow-Effect through smooth interactions +
**Scenario:** Component manipulation during demo +
**Source:** User performing drag operations +
**Stimulus:** Dragging components across the canvas +
**Environment:** Modern browser on typical hardware +
**Response:** Fluid, lag-free visual feedback +
**Response Measure:** No visible stuttering or delay during drag operations

**Technical Requirements:**
- 60fps during drag operations
- Immediate visual feedback on mousedown
- Smooth movement tracking cursor position

|===
| Quality Scenario | Priority | Measurable | Critical | Implementation Strategy
| **Time-to-Market (QS-001)** | 1 | Yes | High | Simple tech stack, focus on core features
| **Usability Assessment (QS-002)** | 2 | Yes | Medium | Intuitive interactions, standard patterns  
| **Smooth Drag&Drop (QS-003)** | 3 | Yes | Low | SVG manipulation optimization

=== 10.4 Quality Trade-offs

**Primary Trade-off: Usability vs. Development Speed**

When time pressure conflicts with usability improvements:
- **Decision Rule**: Choose simpler implementation that works reliably
- **Rationale**: A working simple solution beats a broken complex one
- **Example**: Standard HTML inputs instead of custom UI components

**Secondary Trade-off: Wow-Effect vs. Stability**

When visual polish conflicts with functional stability:
- **Decision Rule**: Prioritize functional completeness
- **Rationale**: Demo must work first, look good second
- **Example**: Basic styling over animated transitions

=== 10.5 Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Page load time: < 3 seconds on broadband
- Component creation: < 200ms response time
- Export generation: < 2 seconds for typical maps

**Compatibility:**
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- No mobile browser support required for MVP
- JavaScript ES6+ features assumed available

**Maintainability:**
- Self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Minimal complexity for future extensibility
- Separate concerns (model, view, export)
