=== Problem Description and Context

We need to define the user interaction model for the Wardley Map Editor. The solution must be implementable within our remaining 20 minutes while providing intuitive map editing capabilities.

=== Alternative Evaluation (Pugh Matrix)

|===
| Criterion | Mouse-Only (Baseline) | Touch Support | Keyboard Shortcuts
| Implementation Speed | 0 | -2 | -1
| Code Complexity | 0 | -2 | -1
| Browser Testing | 0 | -2 | 0
| Demo Focus | 0 | -1 | -1
| User Experience | 0 | +1 | +1
| **Total Score** | 0 | -6 | -2
|===

**Rejected Alternatives:**

**Touch Support:** Requires handling touchstart/touchmove/touchend events with different coordinate systems. Additional complexity for device testing.

**Keyboard Shortcuts:** Would require key binding management and user documentation. Not essential for basic demo functionality.

=== Decision

**We choose Mouse-Only interaction** for the initial implementation.

**Rationale:**
- **Time Efficiency:** Single event model (mousedown/mousemove/mouseup)
- **Demo Environment:** Live stream likely uses desktop browser
- **Testing Simplicity:** No cross-device testing required
- **Clear Implementation:** Straightforward drag & drop implementation

=== Consequences

==== Positive Effects

- **Rapid Development:** Single interaction model to implement
- **Predictable Behavior:** Consistent mouse event handling across browsers
- **Easy Debugging:** Clear event flow for live demonstration

==== Risks

- **Limited Accessibility:** No keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile Limitation:** Not usable on touch devices

==== Technical Debt

**Minor.** Touch support could be added later with minimal refactoring by extending existing mouse event handlers.

=== Implementation Notes

**Event Handling:**
```javascript
// Component drag & drop
component.addEventListener('mousedown', startDrag);
document.addEventListener('mousemove', drag);
document.addEventListener('mouseup', endDrag);

// Canvas click for new components
canvas.addEventListener('click', addComponent);
```

**Coordinate Handling:**
```javascript
function getMousePosition(event, svg) {
  const rect = svg.getBoundingClientRect();
  return {
    x: event.clientX - rect.left,
    y: event.clientY - rect.top
  };
}
```
