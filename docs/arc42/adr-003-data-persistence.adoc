=== Problem Description and Context

We need to decide how to persist Wardley Map data between browser sessions. The solution must work without server infrastructure and be implementable within our time constraints.

=== Alternative Evaluation (Pugh Matrix)

|===
| Criterion | LocalStorage (Baseline) | IndexedDB | No Persistence
| Implementation Speed | 0 | -2 | +1
| Data Capacity | 0 | +1 | -2
| Browser Support | 0 | -1 | +1
| API Complexity | 0 | -2 | +1
| Demo Value | 0 | 0 | -2
| **Total Score** | 0 | -4 | -1
|===

**Rejected Alternatives:**

**IndexedDB:** More powerful but asynchronous API adds complexity. 5-10MB capacity not needed for demo maps.

**No Persistence:** Would frustrate demo users who lose work on page refresh.

=== Decision

**We choose LocalStorage** for map data persistence.

**Rationale:**
- **Simple API:** Synchronous JSON.stringify/parse operations
- **Sufficient Capacity:** 5MB limit more than adequate for demo maps
- **Universal Support:** Available in all target browsers
- **Immediate Implementation:** No complex async handling required

=== Consequences

==== Positive Effects

- **Fast Implementation:** Simple key-value storage, no complex data modeling
- **User Experience:** Maps persist across browser sessions
- **No Infrastructure:** Client-side only, no server dependencies

==== Risks

- **Storage Limits:** 5MB browser limit (not relevant for demo scope)
- **Browser Clearing:** Data lost if user clears browser storage (acceptable for demo)

==== Technical Debt

**None.** LocalStorage meets all demo requirements without over-engineering.

=== Implementation Notes

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
const mapData = {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  title: "My Wardley Map",
  components: [
    {id: "comp1", label: "User Needs", x: 0.2, y: 0.9}
  ],
  dependencies: [
    {from: "comp1", to: "comp2"}
  ],
  lastModified: new Date().toISOString()
};

localStorage.setItem('wardley-map', JSON.stringify(mapData));
```
