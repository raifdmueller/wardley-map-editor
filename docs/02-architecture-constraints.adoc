== Chapter 2: Architecture Constraints

=== 2.1 Technical Constraints

**Development Environment:**
[cols="2,4", options="header"]
|===
| Constraint | Description
| **Live Development** | Complete implementation during 1-hour live stream with audience
| **Browser-Only** | No server-side components, purely client-side application
| **No Dependencies** | Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+ without external libraries
| **GitHub Pages Hosting** | Static file hosting, no build process or server configuration
| **Modern Browser Support** | Chrome, Firefox, Safari current versions (no IE support needed)
|===

**Technology Stack Limitations:**
- No Node.js build tools or bundlers
- No external CSS/JS frameworks (Bootstrap, React, etc.)
- No server-side APIs or databases
- No authentication or user management
- No file system access beyond browser LocalStorage

=== 2.2 Organizational Constraints

**Development Process:**
[cols="2,4", options="header"]
|===
| Constraint | Impact
| **Live Stream Format** | All development visible to audience, including failures and debugging
| **Time Limit** | Hard 1-hour deadline, no preparation or pre-built components
| **Educational Purpose** | Code must be understandable and well-commented for learning
| **Human-AI Collaboration** | Decision-making process must be transparent and documented
|===

**Quality Constraints:**
- No unit tests or automated testing (time constraint)
- Basic error handling only (happy path focus)
- Minimal documentation during development
- No performance optimization beyond basic good practices

=== 2.3 Legal and Business Constraints

**Open Source:**
- MIT License for unrestricted use and modification
- All code publicly available on GitHub
- No proprietary components or third-party licenses

**Intellectual Property:**
- Content created live on stream, no pre-existing IP conflicts
- draw.io XML format is publicly documented
- Wardley Mapping methodology is open and unrestricted

=== 2.4 Deployment and Runtime Constraints

**Infrastructure:**
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages static hosting only
- **CDN**: GitHub's global CDN for asset delivery
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage (5-10MB limit per domain)
- **Offline**: Basic offline functionality through browser caching

**Performance Requirements:**
- Loading time: < 3 seconds on modern broadband
- Interaction response: < 100ms for drag operations
- Memory usage: < 50MB for typical maps (< 20 components)
- Mobile support: Not required for MVP

**Security:**
- No sensitive data handling required
- Client-side only, no server attack surface
- Standard browser security model sufficient
